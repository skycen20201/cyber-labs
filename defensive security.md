"Responsibilites of Defensive Security"
  Monitoring and Detecting

Continually observing network and system activity to detect suspicious behaviour and events.

  Incident Response

The team quickly comes together if suspicious activity is confirmed and alerts are raised.

  Threat Intelligence

Gathering and using information about attackers—their latest methods, targets, and trends—can greatly strengthen an organisation’s defences.

  Vulnerability Management

Fixing software or system flaws is an important preventative measure that can lower the risk of an attack.

  Investigation and Analysis

Members of a defensive security team are always monitoring and analysing what’s happening inside an organisation.
